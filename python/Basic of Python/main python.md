Note for python

# Variables
> reserved space in the computer's memory
> age = 21 # Here computer reserves a space to store the value 21 for age

variable has 3 parts, `age` itself is a label as variable name, `21` is the variable value, and in addition `variable type` for 21 it is gonna be `int`. 

variable name/label = It needs to be descriptive enough to know what it is about. It is a general practice that community follows for easeness of reading and writing.
- Creation of variable:
`variableName = variableValue`

#### Boolean Variables (bool)

- True
- False
# Inputs

Inputs can be taken from user using built in function of python `input`, it takes input as `string ` format and if we need input in different data types we convert it or ask for input function to take particular data types

```python
age = int(input"Provide your age: ")
```


# Conditionals

It is the process used to check certain condition with another conditions.
 - `bool` condition for True and False comparison
 - There are some comparison comparison operators
	 - == Equal to
	 - != Not equal to
	 - < less than
	 - > Greater than
	 - <= Less than or equal to
	 - >= Greater than or equal to
- Logical operators
	- and (Evaluates to True if both are True)
	- or (Evaluates if either one  is true)
	- not (Evaluates True if False and vice versa)
- If then Statement
- 


# Functions
```python
def function_name(inputs):
	function
	return(output)
```
