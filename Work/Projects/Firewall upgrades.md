# Overview
**Project Title:** Firewall Updates

**Project Objective:** The objective of this project is to update the existing firewall system in order to enhance security, improve performance, and comply with industry standards.

# Project Scope
The scope of this project includes:

1. Conducting a thorough assessment of the current firewall system
2. Identifying the areas that need improvement
3. Developing a plan for implementing the updates
4. Implementing the updates
5. Testing the updated firewall system
6. Providing training to staff members on how to use the updated firewall system.

# Project Plan

1. Assessment Phase (Duration: 2 weeks)
	- Identify all existing firewalls and their configurations
	- Review firewall logs and reports from previous months to identify any security incidents or issues with performance 
	- Identify areas that require improvement 
	- Analyze current industry standards and best practices

2. Planning Phase (Duration: 3 weeks)
	- Develop a plan for implementing updates based on assessment results 
	- Coordinate with relevant stakeholders such as IT team, network team, and security team 
	- Develop implementation schedule 
	- Obtain necessary approvals 

3. Implementation Phase (Duration: 6 weeks)
	- Install necessary software and hardware components for updating firewalls 
	- Configure new firewall rules and policies based on industry standards and best practices 
	- Test new rules with staff members before applying them across all systems 
	- Update firmware for better performance 

4. Testing Phase (Duration: 1 week)
	- Conduct testing on new firewall rules and policies 
	- Monitor network traffic to ensure proper functioning of firewalls 

5. Training Phase (Duration: 1 week)
	- Provide training sessions to staff members on how to use updated firewalls effectively and efficiently 
	- Provide tips on how to identify potential threats or vulnerabilities within the system

6. Closing Phase (Duration: 1 week)
	- Evaluate project success by analyzing metrics such as improved security, better performance, reduced incidents, and increased user satisfaction 
	- Obtain feedback from staff members on the updated firewall system 
	- Document all updates and changes made to the firewall system 
	- Close out project.
