Hiring Manager  
UNDP Nepal  
Kathmandu, Nepal  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Programme Support Officer (PSO) position with UNDP Nepal, as advertised. With over four years of professional experience in managing programmes, project formulation, and policy support in areas such as human security, climate resilience, and disaster risk reduction, I am confident that my skills and passion for sustainable development make me an excellent candidate for this role.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity as the goals of the "Integrating human security in development programming for building resilience to address multi-dimensional risks in Asia and the Pacific" project align with my personal and professional commitment to advancing climate action and enhancing community resilience. Through my work, I have developed expertise in coordinating with key stakeholders—including government officials, CSOs, NGOs, and the private sector—and ensuring successful project implementation in complex environments.

In my previous roles, I successfully led cross-sectoral teams in Nepal, managing engagements with policymakers and experts, facilitating workshops, and producing knowledge products and reports for various stakeholders. My experience working on climate resilience and disaster management projects has also provided me with the analytical skills required to contribute to the development of the human security framework UNDP seeks to create. Furthermore, my proficiency in producing high-quality reports, excellent interpersonal skills, and ability to adapt to multicultural settings will enable me to effectively contribute to the success of your mission.

The opportunity to support the piloting and finalization of the methodological framework for human security is particularly exciting, and I am eager to apply my knowledge and experience to help achieve the desired outcomes of the project. I am also enthusiastic about contributing to UNDP’s broader initiatives in Environment Climate Risk Management and Disaster Risk Reduction, and actively promoting the spirit of volunteerism within my role.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to the ongoing success of your projects and UNDP's mission in Nepal. Please feel free to contact me at [Phone Number] or via email at [Email Address] to arrange a meeting at your convenience.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
