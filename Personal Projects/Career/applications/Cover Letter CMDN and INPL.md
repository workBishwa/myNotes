Throughout my academic career, I've honed my skills in critically reviewing scientific literature, identifying relevant trends, and integrating complex data into clear, unified reports. These skills have been honed through a variety of research initiatives, such as report writing, thesis development, manuscript preparation for research publications, and poster design and presentation. I've done literature reviews, data analysis, and paper drafting for peer-reviewed publications, which has given me a thorough understanding of the research process. My experience with varied datasets has honed my analytical skills, allowing me to extract useful insights and turn them into high-quality papers.

Along with my research experience, I have a strong understanding of statistical methodologies, which I have used for data analysis and validation of research findings.
